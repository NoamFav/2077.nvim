<h1 align="center">2077</h1>

2077 is a Cyberpunk color scheme for [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

## üöÄMotivation

So at first I was using this [Darkplus](https://github.com/LunarVim/darkplus.nvim) color scheme, then
I wanted something different, so I started searching and I already knew that I wanted something dark
and after a while I realized that I really like cyberpunk design and colors, so I tried to find a
suitable color scheme for neovim but, nada, nothing was really fascinating or convenient so I made my
own.
